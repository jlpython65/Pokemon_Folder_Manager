# Pokemon_Folder_Manager
There are 2 versions of the code. One is the original version with numerous comments on what to change. The other revised
version has those changes implemented. There is a picture of the files I was working with as well and a flowchart describing what I do with said files. I am new to this kind of documenting thing so please give me feedback on that. Is my project clear to you? Is there a better way I can show my revisions for my project? I relied on comments (starting with #) in my first draft but it seems too messy. Am I explaining more than necessary? If not, how can I be more thorough? I am asking this because I feel like I spent too much time (like 2 hours) just putting this together.

the goal of this project is too find each file name which is a number and replacing it with the pokemon's name. These numbers represent the order these Pok√©mon are organized in a dictionary found in the games. Ex. entry 1 will always be Bulbasaur, entry 2 will be Ivysaur, etc. .
